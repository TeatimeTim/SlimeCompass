This is a plugin that helps players find slime chunks without needing to have the world seed.

A slime compass is crafted like a regular compass, but with a slime ball instead of a piece of redstone. When a player right-clicks with a slime compass, it scans a 3x3 area of chunks around the player and points towards the nearest slime chunk. The player also receives a message in chat telling them how many slime chunks were found, including a unique message if there were none. 

Currently the range of the slime compass is not configurable, however I may add a small config file in the future.
